The best way to learn keyboard shortcuts is to use them. There are plenty of lists and cheat sheets available online to help you learn them; therefore, the shortcuts listed here are merely some of the ones we found to be the most useful and/or obscure.

**Tip:** Force yourself to use keyboard shortcuts. The faster you become at navigating around your computer, the more thought you will be able to devote to creating and fixing things.

*Programmers love to use keyboard shortcuts, so if you ever catch yourself thinking "I wish there was a faster way to do this...", there probably is.*
